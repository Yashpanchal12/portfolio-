  <h1>How Small Businesses Can Track Sales Using Power BI</h1>

  <p>
    Many small businesses still track sales using notebooks or basic Excel files.
    This creates confusion and delays in decision-making. Power BI helps businesses
    see sales, profit, and trends clearly in one dashboard.
  </p>

  <h2>The Problem with Traditional Sales Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    Manual tracking leads to errors, no real-time visibility, and unclear profit data.
    Business owners often rely on guesswork instead of facts.
  </p>

  <h2>How Power BI Solves This Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Power BI converts raw sales data into visual dashboards showing daily, monthly,
    and yearly performance with clear charts and KPIs.
  </p>

  <h2>My Process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Collect sales data (Excel / billing software)</li>
    <li>Clean and organize data</li>
    <li>Create Power BI dashboard</li>
    <li>Add KPIs and automate updates</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Business Benefits</h2>
  <p>
    Power BI saves time, improves decision-making, and gives complete control over
    business performance.
